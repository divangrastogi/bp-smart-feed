# BP Smart Feed Curator - User Guide

> **Transform your BuddyPress activity feeds into personalized, engaging experiences**

Welcome to BP Smart Feed Curator! This guide will help you understand and make the most of your new smart activity feed system.

---

## 🎯 What is Smart Feed?

Instead of showing activities in simple chronological order (newest first), Smart Feed analyzes user engagement and personal interests to show the most relevant and interesting content first.

**Traditional Feed**: Shows activities by date - newest at top
**Smart Feed**: Shows activities by engagement - most interesting at top

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### First Steps

1. **Install & Activate** the plugin (see README.md)
2. **Go to Settings**: WordPress Admin → BuddyPress → Smart Feed Settings
3. **Enable Smart Feed**: Check "Enable Smart Feed"
4. **Set Default**: Choose if new users get Smart or Standard feed
5. **Save Settings**

### Test It Out

1. **Visit Activity Page**: Go to your site's activity page
2. **Look for Toggle**: Find the "Smart Feed" toggle switch
3. **Try Both Modes**:
   - Turn ON: See activities sorted by engagement
   - Turn OFF: See activities in chronological order

---

## 📱 How Users Experience Smart Feed

### The Toggle Switch

Users see a clean toggle switch next to BuddyPress activity filters:

```
[All] [Friends] [Groups] [Smart Feed 🔄]
```

- **ON (Checked)**: Smart Feed - activities sorted by engagement
- **OFF (Unchecked)**: Standard Feed - activities sorted by date

### What Changes in Smart Feed?

**Activity Order**: Instead of newest first, most engaging activities appear first
**Content Priority**: Posts with lots of likes/comments/shares bubble up
**Personalization**: Content matching your interests gets boosted
**Time Balance**: Recent engaging content beats old engaging content

### Visual Indicators

- **Toggle Switch**: Shows current feed type
- **Seamless**: No page reloads when switching
- **Responsive**: Works on all devices
- **Accessible**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## 🧠 Understanding the Algorithm

### How Activities Get Scored

Each activity gets a score based on:

| Engagement Type | Points | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **👍 Like** | +1.0 | Shows approval |
| **💬 Comment** | +2.0 | Shows discussion |
| **🔗 Share** | +3.0 | Shows strong interest |
| **👁️ View** | +0.5 | Shows passive interest |

### Time Decay

**Fresh Content Bonus**: Activities < 1 hour old get 20% bonus
**Gradual Decay**: Older activities lose value over 24 hours
**Balance**: Recent engaging content stays relevant

### Personal Interests

**Learning**: Plugin learns what content you interact with
**Boosting**: Similar content gets shown higher
**Privacy**: Learning happens locally, no data shared

### Example Scoring

```
Activity: "Check out this amazing photo!" (posted 2 hours ago)
- 15 likes (+15.0 points)
- 3 comments (+6.0 points)
- Freshness bonus (+20%) = +4.2 points
- Total Score: 25.2 points

Activity: "What's everyone up to?" (posted 30 minutes ago)
- 2 likes (+2.0 points)
- 0 comments (+0 points)
- Freshness bonus (+20%) = +0.4 points
- Total Score: 2.4 points

Result: Photo activity appears above question activity
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Theme Integration

**Check Current Feed Type:**
```php
if (function_exists('bpsfc_is_smart_feed_active')) {
    $is_smart = bpsfc_is_smart_feed_active();
    echo $is_smart ? 'Smart Feed Active' : 'Standard Feed';
}
```

**Get Activity Score:**
```php
$score = bpsfc_get_activity_score($activity_id);
echo "Engagement Score: " . number_format($score, 1);
```

### Custom Styling

Add to your theme's CSS:
```css
/* Custom toggle colors */
.bpsfc-toggle-slider {
    background-color: #007cba;
}

/* Hide toggle on mobile */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .bpsfc-feed-toggle {
        display: none;
    }
}
```

### Advanced Hooks

**Modify Scoring:**
```php
add_filter('bpsfc_activity_score', function($score, $activity_id, $user_id) {
    // Add custom scoring logic
    return $score + custom_calculation($activity_id);
}, 10, 3);
```

**Custom Interests:**
```php
add_filter('bpsfc_user_interests', function($interests, $user_id) {
    // Modify user interest calculation
