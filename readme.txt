Intelligently re-ranks BuddyPress activity feeds based on user engagement metrics and personalized interests. Users can toggle between smart and chronological feeds.

== Description ==

BP Smart Feed Curator transforms BuddyPress activity feeds into personalized, engaging experiences using advanced algorithms that analyze user interactions.

**ðŸš€ Key Features:**

* **Smart Algorithm**: Re-ranks activities based on likes, comments, shares, and views
* **Personalized Interests**: Learns user preferences from their interactions
* **Time Decay**: Prioritizes recent, engaging content with intelligent decay
* **Freshness Bonus**: Highlights new activities with engagement potential
* **User Toggle**: Switch between Smart Feed and Standard chronological feed
* **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive analytics and performance monitoring
* **REST API**: Full API support for custom integrations
* **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on all devices and themes
* **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant with ARIA support
* **Performance Optimized**: Caching, batch processing, and efficient queries

**How It Works:**

The plugin analyzes user engagement patterns:
- **Likes (+1.0)**: Shows approval and interest
- **Comments (+2.0)**: Indicates discussion and engagement
- **Shares (+3.0)**: Strongest signal of interest
- **Views (+0.5)**: Passive engagement tracking
- **Time Decay**: Recent activities lose less value over time
- **Personalization**: Learns and boosts content matching user interests

**Example:**
```
Activity A: 15 likes, 3 comments, 2 hours old = Score: 25.2
Activity B: 2 likes, 0 comments, 30 minutes old = Score: 2.4
Result: Activity A appears above Activity B (better engagement)
```
